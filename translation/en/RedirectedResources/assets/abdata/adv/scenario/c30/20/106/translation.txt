「ここの夜景は何度も見ても綺麗ね。キミが隣にいるっていうのが、また最高っ！」=No matter how many times I see this night sky, it's still just as pretty as that day... I love being here with you!
「一人で見てたら、ここまで感動はしないのかもね」=Seeing this scenery alone would probably not feel as moving, would it
「ええ、そうだと思うわ。好きな人と一緒に見る景色だから、何度見ても飽きないのよ、きっと……」=Yep, I think so. This kind of scenery, you have to enjoy it with a loved one. I don't think I could get bored of it...
「ここはもう、すっかり二人のお気に入りスポットだね」=This place is already one of our favourite spots, isn't it
「こういう場所を、どんどん増やしていきたいわ……キミとの思い出、もっとたくさん作りたい」=I want to have even more spots like this with you. I want to create even more beautiful memories with you...
「うん、俺も。[H名]との思い出、いっぱい作りたい」=Yeah, same here. I want to create loads of memories with you, [H名].
「ふふ、キミが作りたいとか言うと……子作りを連想しちゃうわね……」=Fufu, when you say it, I can't help but feel like you're talking about making babies instead...
「えぇっ、俺ってそんな風に見られてたの？」=Eeeh? Do you think of me like that?
「だって、こんなに綺麗な夜景を見た後に、する事しちゃったじゃない……流石に忘れられないわ」=I can't help it, just after we had looked at this scenery together for the first time, we did the deed... There's no way I could forget it.
「あっ、もしかして……キミがここをお気入りな理由って、私とそういう事をしやすいからなの？」=Ah, maybe... Is this your favourite spot because it's easy for you to take me in this place?
「いや、それは……えぇっと……」=No, that's... Uhm...
「全部じゃないけど……そういう理由も、少しはあるかも……」=It's not the whole reason but... it is a small part of it, yes...
「ふふ、キミの言う少しはどれくらいなの？　半々くらい？」=Fufu, when you say "small part", just how small do you mean? About half?
「えっと……それよりちょっと……エッチ寄りかな……」=Uhm... Rather than just half... It's mostly that...
「もう、伏せて言ってたのに……本当にキミは、欲望に正直なんだから……」=Jeez~, Didn't I tell you to be less blunt with that kind of thing... You're honest about your lust to a fault...
「ごめん……少しはムードも考えろって感じだよね？」=Sorry... I should think about the mood more, shouldn't I?
「うーん、わかっているなら実践してくれると嬉しいんだけど……まだキミには難しいのかしら？」=If you understand then I'd like to see you actually try doing that sometime... I wonder if its still too hard for you?
「うっ……そうだね。ちょっとその……[H名]が可愛すぎるからいけないんだよ？」=Uuh, You're right. It's just that... You're so cute, [H名], that I can't help it.
「えぇっ、そこで私のせいになっちゃうの？　そっかぁ、お姉さんのせいかぁ……」=Eehh? You're making it my fault now? I see... So it's my fault, huh?
「……なら、責任取らなくっちゃね」=...then, I'll have to take responsibility, no?
「えっ、あっ、いや……そこまで本気で言ったわけじゃなくて……」=Eh, Ah, No... I didn't mean that so seriously...
「なぁに？　お姉さんは可愛くないの？　お世辞だったんだ……しゅーん」=Wha~t? So you're saying Im not cute? It was flattery, huh? Hmph~
「しゅーん、て……うぅ、可愛いよ！　そういう仕草とか、ズルいくらい可愛い！」=Don't pout... Uh... You're really cute! Even that acting of yours, it's so cute it's unfair!
「ふふ、キミがそうやって顔真っ赤にしちゃうのも可愛いよ。じゃあ、お互いに可愛い顔の見せっこ、しちゃおうか？」=Fufu, you saying that with a flushed face like that is also really cute. Then, should we both enjoy each other's cute faces?
「うん、そうだね。あんまりここで騒いでると目立っちゃうし……そろそろ移動しよう」=Yea, let's do that. If we make too much of a racket here, we'll stand out... We should move to a different place.
「そんなんじゃないって……俺って、[H名]の体しか見てないと思われてるの？」=...It's not like that! Do you think that I think of nothing but your body all day, [H名]?
「あっ……ごめんね。私、ちょっと調子に乗っちゃったみたい……どうしたら機嫌、直してくれるかな？」=Ah... Sorry. I got carried away... How should I fix this mood...
「大丈夫、怒ってるわけじゃないよ。ただ、体目当てとか思われてたら、悲しいなって……」=It's fine, don't worry about it. It's not like I'm angry or anything. It's just, if you think that I only like you for your body... I'd be really sad...
「そう、だよね……お姉さん、ちょっとデリカシーなさ過ぎたかも……本当にごめんね……」=Sorry, that's my bad... Onee-san really lacks tact, doesn't she? I'm really sorry...
（あれ……まずいな……こんな重い空気にしたいわけじゃなかったんだけど……）=( Eh... This is awkward... I didn't mean to turn it into such a heavy atmosphere...)
「あっ！　流れ星！」=Ah! Look, a shooting star!
「えっ、どこ？　……って、嘘ね？　ふふ、そういう気の使い方もできるようになってるのね、キミは」=Eh? Where?... You got me. Fufu, you've already become used to changing the mood like that, haven't you.
「はは……ちょっと強引かなと思ったけど、[H名]と暗い雰囲気のまま別れるのは嫌だなって……」=Haha, I thought it was a bit forced but... I didn't want to part ways with such a dark atmosphere between us...
「えっ……別れるって……ぇと、今日はって事よね？　まさか……」=Eh... Part ways...? Uhm, you mean for today, right? Perhaps... No way...
「わぁっ、違う違う！　もう暗いし、送っていくって意味だって！　はぁ……本当に、そういう意味じゃないからね！」=Woah, No, It's not like that! It's already dark out, I just meant to drop you off back home! Haah, Seriously, I didn't mean it that way!
CHOICE:『そうかも……です』=Yea... Let's part ways here.
CHOICE:『違うよ、そうじゃないって』=No, I didn't mean it like that!
