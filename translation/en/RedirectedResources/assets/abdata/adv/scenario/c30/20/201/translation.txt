「うわ、予想はしてたけど……どこも凄い混雑だね……」=Wow. I expected a crowd but... this is on another level...
「遊園地だもの、仕方ないわよ。この混雑も楽しむくらいでいかないとねっ」=Well, it can't be helped, it's an amusement park afterall. This crowd is also one of the "features" of places like these, so we might as well enjoy it.
「あぁ、[H名]が彼女でよかったよ……」=Aaah, I'm so glad you're my girlfriend, [H名]...
「え？　急にどうしたの？　私、そこまで特別なこと言ったかしら？」=Eh? What's this all of a sudden? Did I really say something that impressive?
「いやほら……遊園地デートって、失敗しやすいって言うし……」=Well, I mean, amusement park dates are really easy to screw up, aren't they?
「あぁ、それ知ってるわ。遊園地デートすると別れるとか……そういう嫌な噂でしょ？」=Aah, I know what you mean. You're talking about the nasty things like being split up midway and such, aren't you?
「う、うん……ごめんね、何もしないうちから、こんな話しちゃって……」=Y-Yeah... Sorry. I didn't mean to talk about things like these before we even did anything...
「ふふ、気にしないで？　私もね、実はちょっと心配してたの……」=Fufu, Don't worry about it. To tell you the truth, I was also a bit worried about things like that...
「えっ、[H名]も？　[H名]はいつも通り、自信満々かと思ってた」=Eh? You too, [H名]? I thought you were full of confidence as usual.
「あら、私って、いつも自信満々だと思われてたの？　逆よそれ、キミといる時は、かなりおっかなびっくりなの……」=Oh? "As usual"? You think I'm always full of confidence? It's the opposite, you know? Whenever I'm with you, I'm always super nervous.
「そうなの？　そういう風には見えなかったけどなぁ……」=Is that so? Never looked that way to me...
「そこはお姉さんの意地ってやつよ……でも、ちょっとはわかって欲しかったかなぁ」=Well, I have my pride as an onee-san, after all. Can't let something like that show on the surface. But, you know, sometimes, I wish you'd notice things like that...
「だ、だよね……うぅ、まだまだ俺も、[H名]のことわかってないんだなぁ……」=Y-You're right... Oof, in the end, I still don't understand a thing about you, [H名]. 
「だったらほら、折角遊園地にいるんだから、立ち話じゃなくて、何かしましょ？　ね？」=In that case, instead of standing around talking, let's do something, alright? It's not like we get to come to the amusement park everyday.
「だね！　といっても……何からやっていこうか？」=Right! That said... What should we start with?
「あら、そこでまた止まっちゃうの？　うーん、じゃあお姉さん、アレに乗ってみたいかもっ！」=Eh? You're really gonna get stuck there? Then, I suppose, let's go on that one, I wanna try it.
「えぇっ、アレって……ジェットコースターのことだよね？　い、一番混んでるよ？」=Eeh, by "that", you mean the Jet Coaster, right? Isn't that super crowded tho?
「うん、だからよ。何をするか決まらないなら、並んでいる間に考えればいいじゃない。ね？」=Yep, that's why. Since we haven't decided on what we're going to do, why not line up for something first and then think about it?
「確かに、それはいいアイディアかも。じゃあ、ちょっと長そうだけど、並んでみようか」=Certainly, that's a good idea. Then, it'll take a while but let's try lining up.
「うんうんっ。あ、そうそう、さっきの遊園地デートが難しいって話、待ち時間の会話を続けるのが、一番難しいらしいわよ？」=Yep, Yep! Oh, that's right. That thing you were talking about before, about how amusement park dates are hard and all, you know that trying to keep the conversation going while waiting in a line is the hardest part of it, yea?
「なっ！？　それ、今言う？　うぅ……なんか凄いプレッシャーが……」=Wha-!? You say that now? Uugh... that's some pressure alright...
「ほらほら、そう硬くならないで。大丈夫よ、私とキミなら、一日中でも喋っていられると思うわ」=It's fine, don't get so stiff. It's alright, if it's the two of us, I'm sure we could chat about things all day long.
「そ、そうかな？　そうなるように……頑張るね」=M-Maybe... I hope so...
